# v0.2.0 Release Checklist

This document outlines the steps required to release llima-box v0.2.0 as a **beta release** for real-world testing.

## Release Strategy

**v0.2.0** is a beta release to:
- Get the implementation in users' hands for real-world testing
- Gather feedback and discover edge cases
- Validate the architecture and design choices
- Build confidence before committing to v1.0.0

**v1.0.0** will follow after:
- Real-world testing and feedback
- Bug fixes from v0.2.0 usage
- Comprehensive manual testing on macOS
- Performance validation

## Current Status: Ready for Beta

All core functionality is implemented and unit-tested. Code quality checks pass (when network is available). Ready to release for early adopters.

## v0.2.0 Release Checklist

### 1. Code Quality ✅

- [x] All 4 CLI commands implemented (`shell`, `list`, `delete`, `delete-all`)
- [x] Core functionality complete (VM management, environment isolation, SSH client)
- [x] Unit tests for critical components (naming, SSH, environment manager)
- [x] Code follows Go best practices
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive

**Note**: `make check` should pass when network is available. If network issues occur, CI will validate.

### 2. Documentation Review

- [x] README.md shows beta status
- [x] CHANGELOG.md has all changes documented
- [x] Usage examples are included
- [x] Architecture documentation is complete
- [ ] Verify all documentation links work
- [ ] Add beta warning to README if not present

### 3. CHANGELOG.md Preparation

- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with v0.2.0 section
  - Move all `[Unreleased]` entries to `[0.2.0] - YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Add beta disclaimer
  - List known limitations
  - Encourage feedback and issue reporting

### 4. Build Verification (Optional for Beta)

Since CI handles multi-platform builds:
- [ ] Verify CI builds complete successfully after tag push
- [ ] Test one platform binary if available (macOS ARM64 or AMD64)

### 5. Release Process

```bash
# 1. Update CHANGELOG.md with v0.2.0 section
# Example:
## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-10

**Beta Release** - Not recommended for production use.

# 4. Create pull request and merge to main

# 5. After merge to main, create and push tag
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0 - Beta"
git push origin v0.2.0
```

### 6. Post-Release

- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions release workflow completes
- [ ] Check that release binaries are uploaded
- [ ] Test downloading a release binary (if macOS available)
- [ ] Update README.md with installation instructions for v0.2.0
- [ ] Announce beta release and request testing feedback

## Beta Release Notes Template

```markdown
# llima-box v0.2.0 (Beta)

**⚠️ Beta Release**: This is an early release for testing. Not recommended for production use.
